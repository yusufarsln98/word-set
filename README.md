## Introduction

A great tool for people learning a new language. Learning new words can be tough. You look them up in a dictionary, try to remember them, but soon forget. Some people write these words in notebooks or make study sets online. But as the list of unfamiliar words grows, it can get overwhelming. WordSet is different. It keeps a list of words and their meanings and turns them into study sets automatically with the help of technology. It makes learning words fun with tests. You can use your own sets or sets made by others, making language learning easier and more enjoyable.


## User Stories and Related Scenarios

**Story #1 – Creating Word Sets**

Azra is a primary school student. At school, her English teacher gave her a list of words to learn this week. Azra needs to learn these words by the weekend. For this reason, Azra wants to create a study set from the word list given by her teacher.

**Scenario #1**

The user enters the application and clicks on the file to which they want to add a word set. If they want to make an addition to a set they previously created, they select the set they want to add to. Afterward, they enhance the set by adding words; if they want to create a new set, they first create a set and then add the word list to it. The application prepares flashcards from these words and makes them ready for the user to work with in different modes.

**Story #2 – Studying on Ready-Made Sets**

Yunus is a nurse, and he wants to improve his English, which is currently at the A2 level. However, he doesn't have the time to create study sets because he's currently working.

**Scenario #2**

The sets created by users become accessible to everyone. Other users can access these sets by using the search feature in the application, or they can select one from the popular sets that are already displayed on the homepage and add it to their own lists. Baskasinin seti calisilmaya baslandiginda, card’larin boost degerleri baslangic degerlerine getirilir ve set kullanicinin listesi olarak kopyalanir.

**Story #3 – Tracking Learning Progress**

Yunus, who has been using this application for a while, wants to learn how often he studies, whether he is studying regularly, how many words he has learned, and which sets he should work on and which ones he should not.

**Scenario #3**

Within the application, there is a calendar that displays the days when the user has been studying. This allows the user to track the days on which they have studied. Additionally, the sets the user has learned will be labeled as "completed" and kept in the list, making it easy for language learners to see which lists they have completed.
